# Constrained-Kernel-Regression
My Ph.D dissertation

With  advanced  technologies in data collection and storage, data analysis in modern scientific research and practice has shifted from analyzing a single dataset to coupling several datasets.
Article \cite{chatterjee2016constrained} proposes an approach by formulating some constraints
to link a main ``internal'' dataset and an additional ``external'' dataset. In this article, we consider nonparametric kernel regression in an internal dataset analysis utilizing constraints for auxiliary information from an external dataset with either summary statistics or individual-level data. 
We show that the proposed constrained kernel regression estimator is asymptotically normal and is better than the standard kernel regression  without using external information in terms of the asymptotic mean integrated square error. 
Furthermore, we consider the situation where internal and external data have different populations and propose some adjustments to address the difference. 
Simulation results are obtained to confirm our theory and to quantify the improvements from utilizing external data.
